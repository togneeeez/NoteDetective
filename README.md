# NoteDetective : an introduction to API usage to gather information about music
This project is meant to be an introduction to the usage of API and API calls to fetch data from the music API service **'MusicBrainz'**.

## The API
To gather the information about music the project will use API calls of the **MusicBrainz's API**. (for more information: *https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API*)

This will provide us with music's metadata. The project will fetch data, parse the JSON response and provide the requested information to the user.
